# Simple_T0-Do_List
This repository contains a basic implementation of a to-do list application that allows users to add, edit, and remove tasks. It is built using HTML for the structure, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for the interactive functionality.

Adding tasks: Users can enter a task in the input field and click the "Add" button to add it to the list.
Editing tasks: Tasks can be edited by clicking on the task text, making it editable. After editing, users can press Enter or click outside the task to save the changes.
Marking tasks as complete: Users can click on a task to mark it as complete. Completed tasks are visually distinguished from uncompleted tasks.
Removing tasks: Users can remove tasks by clicking on the "Delete" button next to each task.
Local storage: The application saves the tasks in the browser's local storage, allowing users to close the browser and return to the list later without losing their tasks.
The code is structured into separate HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files for ease of understanding and maintainability. The HTML file contains the structure of the web page, the CSS file provides the styling, and the JavaScript file handles interactivity and task management.
